LiRi Bot Homework Assignment
LiriBot is used to take in certain commands about twitter, OMDB, and Spotify apps, giving the user some feedback. This will all be done within the console/terminal window. The attached screenshots should demonstrate the specific commands for each function (twitter, OMDB, Spotify ). 


this Bands in Town site didn't ever send me a api key so I decided to go with the Twitter api instead - if this is a major issue I can change/add it in order to complete the assignment.
